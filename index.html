          Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
          education system, which falls under the command of the government at
          three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the
          Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          the total number of public schools to private schools in India is
          10:3.[7] Education in India covers different levels and types of
          learning, such as early childhood education, primary education,
          secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It
          varies significantly according to different factors, such as location
          (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.

          Let's Build a World Together contains more songs celebrating the fairy
          tale romance of country music's royal couple featuring producer Billy
          Sherrill's Phil Spector-influenced production. Regardless of what the
          reality may have been, country fans couldn't get enough of the pair
          who appeared to be living every word they sang. As Eugene Chadbourne
          of AllMusic astutely observes, "The chemistry that develops between
          partners in a male and female country music duo can sometimes be based
          on fantasy, as was obviously the case with Loretta Lynn and Ernest
          Tubb, who no country listener even imagined for a moment were
          romantically involved. Tammy Wynette and George Jones, on the other
          hand, did have a relationship." The truth was not as idyllic as their
          fans preferred to imagine it. Years later, in the documentary Stand By
          Your Dream, Wynette recalled, "It was very difficult on us, both of us
          being in the business and both of us being together twenty-four hours
          a day. We were constantly together. We never had any breathing room,
          no space...And Jones had a very bad drinking problem, and I knew that
          when we married but, you know, you always think, 'Oh shoot, he'll be
          so happy when he marries me and that'll all stop.' You think you can
          change somebody but you never can.
